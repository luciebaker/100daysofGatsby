Spent a little more time today looking into Gatsby for apps and found a few interesting resources.

The Youtube [Gatsby Dynamic App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVNC61rkFxw) by Ben Award [@benawad](https://twitter.com/benawad) confirmed my previous finding that using Gatsby to build dynamic applications is a very good option. 
The short tutorial provides a demo of how to set up your environment for building a dynamic app in Gatsby that works along with any other static pages. Once set up, it seems that there is little difference to working with a create-react-app project setup. 

Gatsby docs about [Client-only Routes & User Authentication](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/) and the [@reach/router](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/reach-router-and-gatsby/) where also useful.

## Making Progress

So at the end of today, I have a starting point in terms of my setup and am confident that what I am looking at creating is possible using Gatsby. I have a lot to learn yet but I feel, I am on the right track.

I will set this research aside for now and over the next few days, refine the wireframe for my web app idea.  There are also some minor adjustments I want to make to my main site, as well as this [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) blog page. Enough to keep me busy until the second challenge for #100DaysofGatsby is announced! 



#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

As noted yesterday, my goal was to create a new Gatsby blog with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) that would live on its own domain and be specific to the [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge but be linked to [my main site](https://lbmedia.netlify.com/) and have a seamless look and feel. By the end of yesterday, I had everything set up and achieved the first part of my goal but at that point, it really didn’t look that great. So, on today’s schedule was styling, SEO and deploy for the world to see!

## Making it all Look Good

Throwing some CSS magic not the mix certainly helps! Since I wanted a seamless look and feel to my to [my main site](https://lbmedia.netlify.com/) this part was quite easy.
I reused some of my CSS and React components, and .. voila! 

Note that for CSS I use several methods. When required, I use styled components (e.g. background images). For the sake of making things a little quicker I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Then to keep my code organized I use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). 

## SEO

While SEO is not all that important for this specific blog, I thing its good practice to attend to it. At the same time, I added a Twitter card so my posts look nicer (and maybe more appealing to click on!). Gatsby documentation has a very useful page for doing this. Here is the [link](
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/add-seo-component/).

## Deployment

To deploy the new site I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) mainly because I find the process very easy. 

## Summary of Day 2
The 'hard' part of the challenge was completed yesterday to today went smoothly. The whole process, including writing posts for Day 1 and Day 2, took me another 3 hours, which adds up to a total of 7 hours for the challenge to be completed. The code for the end result is on my [Github](
https://github.com/luciebaker/100DaysGatsbyBlog) repo. Overall, I'm happy with it. Now, I have 98 more days to get used to the MDX syntax!

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

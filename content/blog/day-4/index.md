Gatsby is known as a static site generator and it is indeed great for building static websites, but this is misleading; by that, I mean that Gatsby has much more to offer. As Jason Lengstor points out in his presentation titled [Beyond Static With Gatsby & Apollo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNUg1jpj9T0&feature=emb_rel_pause):

> **“React apps are dynamic”**, in turn **“Gatsby sites are React apps”**, which implies that **“Gatsby sites are dynamic”**. 

As such, it stands to reason that what can be done with React can be done with Gatsby. Having a couple of web application ideas in mind, I started investigating options to create these with Gatsby.


## Static vs. Dynamic 

These appears to be some debate as to where static ends and dynamic begins. It seems that until recently the difference between the two was clear. Statics sites were those usually written exclusively in HTML and dynamic sites were those making use of advanced programming and databases in addition to HTML. But, things change and the web is changing or, at least, shifting towards a new modern architecture, such as the [JAMstack](https://lbmedia.netlify.com/insights/jamstack-philosophy), fueling the static vs dynamic debate and making the distinction between the two, increasingly blurry.  

It seems to me that web applications do not live in either the static or dynamic box but rather on a continuum ranging from one to the other, some having more dynamic functionality than others. If we consider that a simple contact form or a the search feature within a blog are dynamic components then we can argue that very few sites are entirely static. 

## Websites vs. Web Application 

Similarly to the static vs. dynamic debate, the website vs. web application debate seems to be quibbling over semantics. Ultimately, it can be argued that as long as a site has an interactive component, no matter how small, then it is a web application.

## Gatsby: Beyond Static

Investigating the topic of ‘Gatsby for apps’ was interesting for several reasons. First, I found several resources of interest including:

[Jason Lengstor’s](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) presentation titled [Beyond Static With Gatsby & Apollo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNUg1jpj9T0&feature=emb_rel_pause);

[Dustin Schau’s](https://twitter.com/schaudustin) Blog post titled: [Gatsby for Apps](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-07-gatsby-for-apps/); and,

A webinar titled: Beyond Static: [Building Dynamic Apps with Gatsby: Learn about creating engaging, dynamic web apps with Gatsby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrBK4yxodXA&t=24s).

What was interesting though is that all the resources I found dated from November 2018 and as we all know, in the world of web development, 14 months is a very long time. 

This observation is possibly a reflection of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) being relatively new and establishing itself as a leader as a static site generator. It is possible that developers currently using other frameworks for web app development are reluctant to move outside their comfort zone and explore Gatsby as an option. Or, maybe it is because of a common misunderstanding of the term ‘static’. 

Since my research on working with Gatsby for developing dynamic web applications is only beginning, it could be that my hypothesis are completly wrong. Maybe, others, who are more experienced in this regard can share their view on the future of Gatsby for web applications.

Based on the resources I have found so far, I established that there is no reason why using Gatsby as a platform for web applications isn’t feasible. In fact, it seems to combine the best of both static and dynamic worlds, and makes a lot of sense. My research shall continue!


## Summary of Days 3 & 4

Other than this post, what I did today was not directly related to the [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge, and involved very little coding, but it was still very much Gatsby related. 

As I noted elsewhere, discovering Gatsby was my Aha moment - that time where it all falls into place and makes sense; not just from a coding/development standpoint but from a bigger picture standpoint of how the web environment is today and where it is heading in the foreseeable future. 

While I am somewhat puzzled as to why using Gatsby for Web Applications isn’t more common, I understand that It takes time for people to discover and then adopt new ways of doing things. If you have any insights or resources on the topic, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/LBMedia7). 


#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

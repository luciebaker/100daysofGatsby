As I noted yesterday, when it comes to tutorials/courses on how to build blogs and basic sites with Gatsby, there are plenty. Finding tutorials/courses that include adding dynamic functionality to Gatsby sites there are very few … but I did find one, that includes using Firebase. I want to try auth0 also but … one thing at a time!

## The Course

The course is on Udemy, titled: [Gatsby JS & Firebase: Build HYBRID realtime + static sites
](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-js-firebase-hybrid-realtime-static-sites/). My primary interest in this course is Firebase. 

## The Site you Build

The site you build in the course is a book club. It uses Firebase database to store data, Firebase storage to store image assets (which are then connected to items in Firebase database). There is a register / login / logout functionality that uses Firebase Auth. Users that are logged in can post comments on the books. Users with admin privileges can also add authors and books. This aspect is managed with Firebase Cloud functions. 

Of course, I’m rarely one to follow along blindly. So my site will apply the same logic but will be about smoothies. It will also have a landing page which will not include direct links to the main smoothie list page even though someone with the url could access it. Once completed, there are several features I think could be added. Whether I get to that or not… time will tell.

## Firebase First Impressions

Getting started with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) and connecting Firebase and Gatsby is relatively quick and easy. ✅ 

I wasn’t particularly impressed with the database component of Firebase. Being used to working with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), which is very user friendly, probably didn’t help. With Contentful, you create your data model and then you’re all set - you just add the data. With Firebase, you create a collection. That collection (like a model) has several fields but you have to re-enter your fields every time you want to add a new item to the collection. As such, you have to be extremely careful entering the variable names - If they don’t match your site crashes. The space given to enter the data is also tiny so if you have a variable such as age, it works fine; if you have a variable such as description with a whole paragraph to include, then it’s not so good. Having to add media assets to Firebase storage and then connecting the storage items to specific Firebase database items isn’t particularly difficult, but it is time consuming, and can lead to errors. 

I understand that storing data in Contentful and Firebase is different and the two are used for different purposes, but the process of data entry in Firebase is definitely not user friendly. This makes my first impression of working with Firebase not so good. A lot more to do yet though so I am hoping this will change.

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

This week’s first challenge is to build a Gatsby Blog from scratch. As the saying goes, there’s more than one way to skin a cat, and, of course, there are many ways to build a Gatsby blog!

Only a few days ago I built a [blog](https://lbmedia.netlify.com/insights/) as part of my main website. Since the aim of the challenge is to learn, building the same would be pointless. So instead, I decided to build a Gatsby blog with MDX, which I knew little about and hadn’t worked with before. I also wanted to create a blog I could use to document my [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge.    

## My Goal in this Challenge

My goal was to create a new Gatsby blog with MDX that would live on its own domain and be specific to the [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge but be linked to [my main site](https://lbmedia.netlify.com/) and have a seamless look and feel.

## What is MDX?

First let me tell you a bit about MDX. According to the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/), MDX is “an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents”. Sounds interesting enough to test it out, right?

Gatsby also has several resources about MDX. The one titled [Writing Pages in MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/writing-pages) provides all sorts of information about working with MDX within the Gatsby ecosystem, ranging from how to import and render JSX components directly in MDX files, to, how to carry out Graphql queries on MDX content. The [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/?=mdx) for the gatsby-plugin-mdx is also very useful and includes links to a bunch of other resources. 

At first glance, I have to say that I am not sold on MDX yet but, who knows… after a 100 days of using it maybe I will be. 

## Summary of Day 1

After a little reading and research on the topic and establishing my goals for the challenge, I set up my work environment. I used [Gatsby’s default](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/) starter since it has dependencies I need already installed (and avoids me doing it). 

I essentially set everything up, including the main page with a list of posts and all that it involves, and the single post template to programmatically create individual post pages.

The whole process took me about 4 hours. To be honest, the result at the end of the day doesn’t look great but everything is there. I’ll attend to the rest tomorrow. Nothing that a bit of magic CSS can’t fix! At the end of the day, I’m quite happy to push my first commit to [Github](
https://github.com/luciebaker/100DaysGatsbyBlog).

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

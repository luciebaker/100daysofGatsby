So I am taking a detour via React (create-react-app), but since Gatsby is built on React I’m counting it as part of the [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge.

This React project, is a discussion for another day but in this project, I’m also working with [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), which happens to be quite different to what I’m used to but surprisingly nice to work with, at least in the context of React and the project I am building.

## Semantic UI (React)

[Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) is known as a minimalist UI component framework for theming websites and web applications. There are two versions: the standard one which uses jQuery and the React version (which I link to in this post), which is jQuery free.
The reason for the 2 versions being that jQuery is a DOM manipulation library but React uses a virtual DOM, so using the ‘standard’ version within react isn’t feasible.

For someone who’s really fussy on styling and spend more time than required on details, I think this could be a good option. From what I’ve seen so far, and what I've had to look up, the documentation is good and provides ‘out-of-the-box’ solutions to most questions. It has very cool features such as 'segments' and 'containers' that just work and look good. 

I am aware that Semantic UI is a ‘one-man-show’, which hasn’t been active for a while and that there is an upcoming Fomantic UI (a community fork of Semantic-UI) gaining popularity. In addition to that there are other options. Having said that, I can only base my judgement on my limited use of Semantic UI, and so far it works very well. 

## Semantic UI & Gatsby

Gatsby docs are great.. really! they are. There is, however, no mention of Semantic UI. So in the next few days, I’ll make an attempt at using semantic UI on a Gatsby site and see if that works; there is no reason why it shouldn’t. If all goes well, I’ll put together a short tutorial page on how to do so. 

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

Yes, I am still on the topic of Gatsby for apps, but going down a rabbit hole finding resources. As I have mentioned before, Gatsby is still new and primarily marketed as a static site generator. On the one hand, thatâ€™s what it is but being built on React, it combines both static and dynamic, so you can have a site with parts that are static while others have all the feature of create-react-app. For a bunch of reasons, this makes building apps with Gatsby very appealing, the downside though is the lack of resources to do so.

I know there are docs and, for most part, they are great but they inform about specific pieces of the puzzle rather than provide an overview, or explain how the various pieces co-exist. I guess that what I'm looking for is a basic recipe that I can build on, rather than information about the specific ingredients (if that makes sense!). Some sort of broad guideline.

Once I figure it out, it is actually something I would like to put together so others, who want to explore building apps with Gatsby, have something to use as a starting point. Think of it as a basic cooking recipe.

In the meanwhile, my quest (and frustration) continues. Having a little time to spare during this second week of the [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge, this is what I will be doing.  

Of course, if anyone knows of good resources, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/LBMedia7)!

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

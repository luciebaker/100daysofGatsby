The [#100DaysofGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofGatsby) challenge continues, even on a Sunday! .. though on Sundays I tend to work less and do things I enjoy more - you guessed it: styling! 

I few days back, [I wrote about styling](https://lbmedia-100daysofgatsby.netlify.com/day-7) and more specifically [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs). 

Gatsby is based on React components and having a styling method that also focussed on components makes sense, so for my new Gatsby / Firebase project I wanted to try out using only styled components.
This project is part of [a course](https://lbmedia-100daysofgatsby.netlify.com/day-11) and I could just follow what the instructor does, code-along style, but, as always, I make the project my own. That probably makes my task more difficult but I don't believe coding along blindly leads to learning. Rather, I believe in applying the logic to personal projects and going beyond course contents.

## Long Story Short... 

It takes a bit of getting used to but it works well and some aspects of it are great. Having said that, for components that require a lot of styling and media queries it does feel a bit messy. This is only a first impression though and maybe Iâ€™ll get used to it. 

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

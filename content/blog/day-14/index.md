As you might know, for the past few days, I’ve been working on a Gatsby / Firebase site, and I was hoping to deploy it today. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen because I ran into more issues with Firebase. After trying to fix the issue for a while without success I decided it was best to leave it for now and look at it again at a later date. 

For most part the course has been good but working with Firebase hasn’t been easy. The instructor appears to be knowledgeable but the way he explains firebase isn’t working for me. Let’s just say, my learning style doesn’t match the teaching style. 

Before being able to finish this project I need to work out Firebase. Once that is done, I’ll be able to get back to it, complete it and deploy it! 

To summarize the last few days:

Working with Gatsby ✅

Linking Gatsby and Firebase ✅

Styling the site using styled components ✅

❌ Working with Firebase - Not such a great experience so far. 

❌ Deploying the site - On hold for now. 


#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!

Authentication is the basis for securing data and content and its one of the main ingredients of a web application. So… in my ongoing “Gatsby for apps” quest, I am looking into authentication.

First stop, Gatsby’s documentation on [Building a Site with Authentication](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-a-site-with-authentication/). Here, several options are highlighted. The two options I’m interested in for now are Firebase and Auth0.

## Firebase vs Auth0 : What are the differences?

According to [stackshare.io](https://stackshare.io/stackups/auth0-vs-firebase), “Auth0 can be classified as a tool in the **User Management and Authentication** category, while Firebase is grouped under **Realtime Backend / API**”. That in itself suggest that although both are a method for authentication, their application is quite different.

Put simply, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) is a cloud service designed to power real-time, collaborative applications, whereas, [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a token-based single sign on (and user management) for your apps and APIs with social, databases and enterprise identities. 

At this point I have to conclude that choosing one over the other mainly depends on your needs. For example, firebase would be better suited to any app requiring live updates. 
As such, it might be useful to have both options in your toolbox. Of course, those are not the only two available, they are just two of the most popular choices.

## Working with Gatsby and Firebase

When it comes to tutorials/courses on how to build blogs and basic sites with Gatsby, there are plenty. Finding tutorials/courses that include adding dynamic functionality to Gatsby sites there are very few … but I did find one, which I will start tomorrow, and tell you more about then. 

#### Till tomorrow, Happy coding!
